## Creating a CSV File

To create a CSV file using the `csv_maker.py` script, follow the steps below:

   python csv_maker.py
   ```

2. The script will prompt you to enter the number of data entries you want in the CSV file. Provide the desired number and press Enter.

3. The script will generate a CSV file with the specified number of data entries.

## Running the Main Program

To run the main program, execute the following command:
