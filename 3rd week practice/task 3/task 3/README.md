# Sales Analysis

This Python program performs sales analysis based on customer data stored in a CSV file. It allows you to input a customer code and generates sales charts and statistics for that customer.

## Usage

1. Prepare your customer data in a CSV file named "orders.csv". Each row represents a customer order and should include the following columns: code, product_name, month_number, base_price, quantity, total_price.

2. Run the Python program and follow the prompts.

3. Enter the customer code when prompted. The program will generate:

   - Sales Quantity per Month chart: A chart showing the sales quantity per month for the specified customer.

   - Price per Month chart: A chart showing the price per month for the specified customer.

   - Product Quantity: A table displaying the total quantity of each product purchased by the customer.

4. The sales charts are saved as images in the current directory.
