# mina.py and better_main.py

## Description
This repository contains two Python files, `main.py` and `better_main.py`, which demonstrate the concept of inheritance and dataclasses in Python.

## `main.py`
The `main.py` file defines a class hierarchy of living beings, including humans, animals, dogs, and cats. Each class inherits from the `LivingBeing` class and overrides the `eat` and `sleep` methods. The `Human` class also has an additional `work` method, while the `Animal` class has a `make_sound` method. The `Dog` and `Cat` classes further override the `make_sound` method to produce specific sounds.

To run the code in `main.py`, simply execute the file using a Python interpreter.

## `better_main.py`
The `better_main.py` file is an improved version of the `main.py` code, utilizing the `dataclass` decorator from the `dataclasses` module. This decorator simplifies the creation of classes by automatically generating special methods such as `__init__`, `__repr__`, and `__eq__`.

The class hierarchy and methods in `better_main.py` are the same as in `main.py`, but the syntax is cleaner and more concise. To run the code in `better_main.py`, execute the file using a Python interpreter.

## Usage
You can use these files as a reference to understand how inheritance works in Python and how to create classes using the `dataclass` decorator. Feel free to modify the code and experiment with different scenarios.

To run the code, make sure you have Python installed on your system. Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory containing the files, and execute the desired file using the Python interpreter. For example:

```
python main.py
```

or

```
python better_main.py
```
